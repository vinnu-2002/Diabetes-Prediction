Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how the body regulates blood sugar (glucose) levels. Glucose is vital for providing energy to cells, and insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps glucose enter cells from the bloodstream. In diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood.""")
